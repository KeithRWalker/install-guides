# install-guides WIP
Just a place to save some instructions from class on installs/setups for projects

# React Install (Bootstrap/Firebase/scss/eslint(airbnb))
### Features
* REACT with JSX
* ES6+ (all the es6 stuff we love writing with)
* Autoprefixes CSS (no need to add in all the -webkit stuff)
* Unit test runner (Jest is already installed and configured)
* Live development server (make some changes and the app automatically reloads)
* Build scripts to bundle all the things (JS, CSS, images, and sourcemaps)
* Offline service works (you can technically do development offline)
* Hassle free updates (if a new version of create-react-app comes out you just update the version in the package.json file)
---
### Step By Step
###### Github Stuff
* In gitbash type ` npx create-react-app name-of-directory ` @ the local location you want the project
* Create github project (name it the same as local dir for your sanity)
* Copy SSH info from github
* in gitbash/terminal `npm remote add origin <SSH INFO HERE>`
* `git checkout -b setup`
